# MDAI Testing

A repo containing various methods of testing MDAI functionality.

----

## How would you like to test?

### TelemetryGen

I don't have any existing agents/collectors that I can use to send telemetry right now.

[Start with TelemetryGen now!](./testing/telemetrygen.md)


### Postman & mock MLT payloads

I want to send some payloads using Postman to my MDAI Cluster!

[Send sample data with Postman](./testing/postman.md)


### curl or grpcurl & mock MLT payloads

I want to use my terminal to send some payloads using Postman to my MDAI Cluster!

[Send sample data via terminal](./testing/curl_grpcurl.md)


### Real Collectors, Real pipelines

I have existing sources of telemetry I'd love to point to my new MDAI Cluster!

[Setup your collectors with OTel pipelines now!](./testing/real_collector_agent.md)
